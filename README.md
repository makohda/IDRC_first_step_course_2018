# Background
## What exome analysis is?
Simply saying, based on genetic knowledge, find out causative variants from not so big data.  
It also requires some computational skills.

## What are required to exome analysis?
1. knowledge of genetics
1. knowledge of target diseases, especially for genetic background
1. knowledge of associated databases (how to find the information you want)
1. knowledge of exome sequencing/high speed sequencers/molecular biology
1. some skills of computers

Although not absolute, it becomes more important in order from top to bottom.  
This is completely my biased list, so I can agree with 3 or 4 or 5 in reverse/change.

# Aim
This mini-course is made for a lecture which let you get a first tiny step to bioinformatic analysis.  
It assumes that this is made for step by step hands-on style, but this could be applied to self studying.  
Do not be afraid. If you failed something, nothing will happen. No sample lost. Not wasting any tips/chips/gels/solutions/enzymes/antibodies. Just gain your experiences. Practice makes perfect:wink:  

This course will cover:
- customise your macintosh environment for running bioinformatic programs
- experience simple target resequence data analysis
- understand what steps are there (alignment, remove duplicate, variant call..etc)
- how interpretate variants

Not cover:
- how algorithmn works
- how to handle massive amount data using cluster computers
- deep/heuristic/complicated issues/knowledge/techniques/pitfalls (e.g. how I sense danger data signs in heystacks)



# :computer: Set up your mac
#### :point_right: Ideally, you should try and complete this section before hands-on
You have to set up your macintosh environment for informatic analyses.  
I know this is a first barricade to step in learning informatic skills, but this shold be done. I tried to make it as easy as possible.

## Install java (Java SE Development Kit 8u181 version)
Java is a kind of programming launguage.  
You need Java itself to run applications developed using Java launguage.

Download Java SE Development Kit 8u181 from here  
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html  
Then, install on your mac

After installation, confirm it by following procedures.  
Open Terminal.app (is located on /Application/Utilities), then type this shell command  
`$ java -version`

If succeeded, you will get following response

    java version "1.8.0_181"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_181-b13)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.181-b13, mixed mode)

## Install homebrew, a nice packge manager for macOS:beer:
A package manager maintains softwares (packages), such as install, update, and remove.  
Of course, you can manage your computer, but we usually use a package manager to make it easier.  
Go to this page, https://brew.sh/ then, follow the install instruction.  
Open Terminal.app (is located on /Application/Utilities), then type this shell command  
`$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`  
_The administrator password will be required in this process_

If succeeded, you will get following response

    ==> Next steps:
    - Run `brew help` to get started
    - Further documentation:
        https://docs.brew.sh

## Let's try to install new command (program, software, or package)
Wget command is a nice download utility for Web.  
`$ brew install wget`  
Try to download something.  
`$ wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/smuyzxmllmoctz1/test_variant_data_01.tsv`  
You can see the contents by this way  
`$ cat test_variant_data_01.tsv`  
Or  
`$ more test_variant_data_01.tsv`  
Or  
`$ less test_variant_data_01.tsv`  
_Push Q key for quit_

more/less is a viewer. Originally, there is more. Then, less was developped.

cat command is concatenate. Concatenate multiple file, like this  
`$ cat fileA fileB`  
Let's test.  
`$ wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/5yfaiolgoi3cp3u/test_variant_data_02.tsv`  
`$ cat test_variant_data_01.tsv test_variant_data_02.tsv`  
To make it easier to see,  
`$ cat test_variant_data_01.tsv test_variant_data_02.tsv | less -S`  
_Push Q key for quit_  
-S is a option of less command. It change less behavior to chop-long-lines.  
Commands have their specific options. You can see like this.  
`$ less --help`  
`$ cat --help`


## Install softwares required for (minimal) sequence analysis
At first, type this, to cover scientific programs well  
`$ brew tap brewsci/bio`

### Install bwa
bwa for aligning reads to the reference genome (version 0.7.17)  
`$ brew search bwa`  
`$ brew info bwa` _see software detail information_  
`$ brew install bwa`  
Type to check the installation  
`$ bwa`  

If installation succeeded, you will get following response  

    Program: bwa (alignment via Burrows-Wheeler transformation)
    Version: 0.7.17-r1188
    Contact: Heng Li <lh3@sanger.ac.uk>
    ...

### Install samtools
SAMtools for manipulating next-generation sequencing data (version 1.9)  
`$ brew search samtools`  
`$ brew info samtools`  
`$ brew install samtools`

### Download demo data and reference genome sequence files for first analysis
I prepared small data which aquired from public sequence database. It's already modified to contain chromosome 1 reads.  
`$ wget -c https://www.dropbox.com/s/eg8k4xmmw23nfnq/DRR006760_chr1_1.fastq.gz`  
`$ wget -c https://www.dropbox.com/s/b4awju0mkt8q3bn/DRR006760_chr1_2.fastq.gz`  

You also need reference genome sequence files.

- Title: Identification of autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia with cerebellar ataxia and neuropathy
- Abstract: Objective: To identify the gene mutation responsible for a family presenting spastic paraplegia, cerebellar ataxia and neuropathy with autosomal recessive transmission. Background: Autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegias (AR-HSP) constitute a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases involving pyramidal tracts dysfunction. The genes responsible for many types of AR-HSPs remain unknown. We attempted to identify the gene responsible for autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with cerebellar ataxia and neuropathy. Methods: The present study included two patients in a Japanese consanguineous family. Their onset of symptoms was 48 and 58 years of age. Neurologic examination and DNA analysis were underwent in two patients and two normal family members. We performed a genomewide linkage analysis employing SNP arrays with two patients’ DNAs and exome sequencing using one patient’s sample. Results: **We identified a homozygous missense mutation in the lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene** in the two patients. This mutation co-segregated with the disease in the family, and located at the well-conserved amino acid. This LYST mutation was not found in 200 Japanese control DNAs. Subsequent hematological analysis in one patient could disclose peroxidase-positive large granules in the patient’s granulocytes, although he had no symptoms according to immunodeficiency or bleeding tendency.Interpretation: We considered these patients as adult Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) presenting spastic paraplegia with cerebellar ataxia and neuropathy. As far as we know, this family is one of the oldest adult CHS cases in the literatures. Clinical spectrum of CHS is broader than previously recognized. Adult CHS must be considered in the differential diagnosis of AR-HSPs. The linkage analysis and exome sequencing were useful for identifying the causative mutation in this family. [less]
