# 1. Background
## What exome analysis is?
Simply saying, based on genetic knowledge, find out causative variants from not so big data.  
It also requires some computational skills.

## What are required to exome analysis?
1. knowledge of genetics
1. knowledge of target diseases, especially for genetic background
1. knowledge of associated databases (how to find the information you want)
1. knowledge of exome sequencing/high speed sequencers/molecular biology
1. computational skills
1. knowledge of ethical problems/privacy protection/IF and SF

Although not absolute, it becomes more important in order from top to bottom.  
This is completely my biased list, so I can agree with 3 or 4 or 5 in reverse/change.


# 2. Aim
This mini-course is made for a lecture which let you get a first tiny step to bioinformatic analysis.  
It assumes that this is made for **step by step hands-on style, but this could be applied to self studying.  
Do not be afraid. If you failed something, nothing will happen. No sample lost. Not wasting any tips/chips/gels/solutions/enzymes/antibodies. Just gain your experiences. Practice makes perfect** :wink:

## This course will cover:
- customise your macintosh environment for running bioinformatic programs
- experience simple target resequence data analysis
- understand what steps are there (alignment, remove duplicate, variant call..etc)
- how interpretate variants

## Not cover:
- how algorithmn works
- how to handle massive amount data using cluster computers (SSH, Grid Job Scheduler, memory usage, disk I/O)
- deep/heuristic/complicated issues/knowledge/techniques/pitfalls (e.g. how can I sense abnormal data signs in heystacks)

## Beyond this course
For further advanced self studies, you already know there are so many pages in the internet :astonished:  
I think these materials might be nice for the next step.  
- The Canadian Bioinformatics workshops (past workshop materials/videos are ready) https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/
- 平成28年度NGSハンズオン講習会カリキュラム NBDC https://biosciencedbc.jp/human/human-resources/workshop/h28-2

# 3. Set up your mac :computer:
#### :point_right: Ideally, you should try and complete this section before hands-on
You have to set up your macintosh environment for informatic analyses.  
I know this is a first barricade to step in learning informatic skills, but this shold be done. I tried to make it as easy as possible.

## Minimal knowledge
- Terminal.app is a application to tell what you want to your computer via command lines
- `$ ` means command line in this page. $ is a prompt, so you don't need type $. Just type following characters
- `$ pwd` pwd means _**P**rint **W**orking **D**irectory_
- **Directory** means Folders in your launguage. In Linux/Unix world, it's directories
- `$ cd` cd means _**C**hange **D**irectory_
- `$ mkdir new_diretory_name` mkdir means _**M**ake **D**irectory_
- `$ cat cnvkit.${platform}.summary.out | cut -f1,8 | perl -pe 's/\n/\t/; s/--/\n/; s/\nPt/Pt/' | perl -pe 's/^\tPt/Pt/' | cut -f4,6,8 | perl -F"\t" -lane 'next if $F[1] == 0 && $F[2] == 0; print join("\t", $F[0]/$F[1], $F[0])' | sort -k1,1g` _Don't be panic. No need to memorise today._ Just want to show you "|", Pipe. "|" connects two command. This is similar with pipetting twice, then centrifuge at 3,000 rpm, 10 min on ice...
- GNU/Linux is a kind of OS (Operation Systems). Same as Windows and macOS. Most of servers are Linux
- Server is a computer, but not for personal use. Expensive/Cheap/High speed/Slow/Big/Small/Mail/Web...too diverse to express
- Linux is a open source copy of UNIX (not exactly)
- macOS is a kind of FreeBSD OS. BSD is a kind of UNIX https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like#/media/File:Unix_history-simple.svg
- UNIX is a OS developed by AT&T and MIT. It has several good features https://www.gotothings.com/unix/unix-features-and-advantages.htm
- Therefore, we frequently recomment to use Mac when you start to use command lines
- **Google is your best friend** :+1:
- may add later (frequently asked words or something)

## Make and move into your working directory
`$ cd ~/` go to your home directory (e.g. /Users/okazaki, /Users/kohda)  
`$ mkdir ~/exome_analysis` make directory named as exome_analysis under your home directory  
`$ cd ~/exome_analysis` move to ~/exome_analysis and use it as our basecamp directory  
All data should be gathered here.

## Install java (Java SE Development Kit 8u181 version)
Java is a kind of programming launguage.  
You need Java itself to run applications developed using Java launguage. For example, IGV, Picard and GATK are Java application. We will install them.

Download Java SE Development Kit 8u181 from here  
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html  
Then, install on your mac.

After installation, confirm it by following procedures.  
Open Terminal.app (is located on /Application/Utilities), then type this shell command  
`$ java -version`

If succeeded, you will get following response

    java version "1.8.0_181"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_181-b13)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.181-b13, mixed mode)

## Install homebrew, a nice packge manager for macOS :beer:
A package manager maintains softwares (packages), such as install, update, and remove.  
Of course, you can manage your computer, but we usually use a package manager to make it easier.  
Go to this page, https://brew.sh/ then, follow the install instruction.

Open Terminal.app (is located on /Application/Utilities), then type this shell command  
`$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`  
_The administrator password will be required in this process_

**In the process, you might be asked "Xcode command line tool installation" by computer. Please permit it. Xcode is a programming environment for macOS. It mainly used by software developer, but it also contains some necessary parts for running command line tools.**  

If succeeded, you will get following response

    ==> Next steps:
    - Run `brew help` to get started
    - Further documentation:
        https://docs.brew.sh

## Let's try to install new command (program, software, or package)
Wget command is a nice download utility for Web.  
`$ brew install wget`  
Try to download something.  
`$ wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/smuyzxmllmoctz1/test_variant_data_01.tsv`  
You can see the contents by this way  
`$ cat test_variant_data_01.tsv`  
Or  
`$ more test_variant_data_01.tsv`  
Or  
`$ less test_variant_data_01.tsv`  
_Push Q key for quit_

more/less is a viewer. Originally, there is more. Then, less was developped.

cat command means con**cat**enate. Concatenate multiple file, like this  
`$ cat fileA fileB`  
Let's test.
```
$ wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/5yfaiolgoi3cp3u/test_variant_data_02.tsv
$ cat test_variant_data_01.tsv test_variant_data_02.tsv
```
To make it easier to see,
```
$ cat test_variant_data_01.tsv test_variant_data_02.tsv > test_variant_data.concatenated.tsv 
$ less -S test_variant_data.concatenated.tsv
```
_Push Q key for quit_  

-S is a option of less command. It change less behavior to chop-long-lines.  
Commands have their specific options. You can see like this.  
```
$ less --help
$ cat --help
```

## Install softwares required for sequence analysis#1
At first, type this, to tell homebrew much more scientific programs

```

To start up IGV, type  
`$ sh IGV_2.4.13/igv.sh -g 1kg_v37`  
Java language will run IGV program. We will use IGV after sequece data alignment.
1kg_v37 specify the human genome version. If this is the first time IGV wake up, it will start downloading automatically.  
You can download the specific version of reference human genome (Human 1kg, b37 + decoy), it can be found in Menu bar "Genomes > Load Genome From Server"  

#### Tips: 1kg? b37?? decoy???
- 1kg means 1000 genomes project http://www.internationalgenome.org/  
- b37 is a version of human genome (build 37), which is provided by Genome Reference Consortium https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc  
- The decoy genome, starting point is here http://www.cureffi.org/2013/02/01/the-decoy-genome/

# 4. First step
Let make your first step. Certainly, this is really small. But, it may become a giant step in the future.  

## First analysis < 20 min
In this section, we will analyze following public data. 
We just prepare (**download by yourself!**) sequence reads, reference genome and related files. Then, align reads (fastq) to the reference human genome using BWA, see the result using IGV.

Followings are summary of data we will use in this section.  
- Title: Identification of autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia with cerebellar ataxia and neuropathy
- Objective: To identify the gene mutation responsible for a family presenting spastic paraplegia, cerebellar ataxia and neuropathy with autosomal recessive transmission.
- Methods: The present study included two patients in a Japanese consanguineous family. Their onset of symptoms was 48 and 58 years of age. Neurologic examination and DNA analysis were underwent in two patients and two normal family members. We performed a genomewide linkage analysis employing SNP arrays with two patients’ DNAs and **exome sequencing using one patient’s sample.**
- Results: **We identified a homozygous missense mutation in the lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene**
- DRA: http://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/DRASearch/study?acc=DRP000999
- **Causative gene: LYST c.4189T>G, p.F1397V**
- Paper: Autosomal-recessive complicated spastic paraplegia with a novel lysosomal trafficking regulator gene mutation. - PubMed - NCBI https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521565

Firstly, download demo data and reference genome sequence files.  
I made small data which aquired from public sequence database. It's already modified to contain chromosome 1 reads only. File size are 54M and 55M (original sizes are 4.8G and 4.9G).  
```
$ wget -c https://www.dropbox.com/s/eg8k4xmmw23nfnq/DRR006760_chr1_1.fastq.gz
$ wget -c https://www.dropbox.com/s/b4awju0mkt8q3bn/DRR006760_chr1_2.fastq.gz
```

You also need reference genome sequence files. Totally, 8.1G will be downloaded (< 10 min).  
```
$ wget -c https://www.dropbox.com/s/9qmtqwgq8pxyj99/human_g1k_v37_decoy.fasta
$ wget -c https://www.dropbox.com/s/9dpu7ver996c8m0/human_g1k_v37_decoy.fasta.amb

$ wget -c https://www.dropbox.com/s/6dkq2f6dokddyqs/human_g1k_v37_decoy.fasta.pac
$ wget -c https://www.dropbox.com/s/4braaqyewooqt4p/human_g1k_v37_decoy.fasta.sa
$ wget -c https://www.dropbox.com/s/drit0y6xu6dnpg7/human_g1k_v37_decoy.dict
```

Secondary, align paired sequence reads to the 1000 genomes project-customised human reference genome build 37 (human_g1k_v37_decoy).  
Alignment.  
```
$ bwa mem -t4 -M \
            -R "@RG\tID:FLOWCELLID\tSM:DRR006760_chr1\tPL:illumina\tLB:DRR006760_chr1_library_1" \
            human_g1k_v37_decoy.fasta \
            DRR006760_chr1_1.paired.fastq.gz DRR006760_chr1_2.paired.fastq.gz > DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads.sam
```
Convert .sam file to .bam format.  
`$ samtools view -@4 -1 DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads.sam > DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads.bam`  
Sort .bam contents.  
`$ samtools sort -@4 -m 2G DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads.bam -o DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads_sorted.bam`  
Make .bam index file to make search.  
`$ samtools index DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads_sorted.bam`

You will get following response. It will take about few min by my MacBookPro 2014 (2.2GHz).  

    [M::bwa_idx_load_from_disk] read 0 ALT contigs
    [M::process] read 396040 sequences (40000040 bp)...
    [M::process] read 396040 sequences (40000040 bp)...
    [M::mem_pestat] # candidate unique pairs for (FF, FR, RF, RR): (0, 142256, 0, 0)
    ...snip

Check generated files.  
`$ ls -vlhrt DRR006760*`

You will see like this.

    -rw-r--r-- 1 mako  55M  7 20 22:09 DRR006760_chr1_2.fastq.gz
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mako  54M  7 20 22:09 DRR006760_chr1_1.fastq.gz
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mako 660M  7 25 13:08 DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads.sam
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mako 158M  7 25 13:54 DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads.bam
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mako 141M  7 25 13:54 DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads_sorted.bam
    -rw-r--r-- 1 mako 1.5M  7 25 13:54 DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads_sorted.bam.bai

Thirdly, see this aligned sequence reads,  
`$ sh IGV_2.4.13/igv.sh DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads_sorted.bam`  

Confirm your selected genome is "Human (1kg, b37+decoy)".  
Go to 1:235,955,287-235,955,418 to see the mutation.

Can you find this? Genomic position of LYST:c.4189T>G:p.F1397V is 1:235955298-235955423 (build 37).

# 5. Second step
More similar with real analysis.  
Using same fastq, but add quality check, trimming, data cleaning for variant call, variant call, annotate variants, interpretation steps.  
And one more, how to estimate propar threshold for MAF (Minor Allele Frequency) for specific disease.

### Install GATK bundle resource 10min
Resouce bundle is a collection of standard files for working with human resequencing data with the GATK.  
Go to resource bundle page https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/bundle  
Read "FTP Server Access" section, and go to ftp site. Dive to b37 directory.  
There are 70 files :astonished:  
Luckly, we only need two files in this course :laughing:  
- dbsnp_138.b37.vcf
- Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf

Download following files, and expand them.
- Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf.gz
- Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf.gz.md5
- Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf.idx.gz
- Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf.idx.gz.md5
- dbsnp_138.b37.vcf.gz
- dbsnp_138.b37.vcf.gz.md5
- dbsnp_138.b37.vcf.idx.gz
- dbsnp_138.b37.vcf.idx.gz.md5

Totally, 1.4G. It takes about 10 mins.

You notice .md5 files. MD5 stands for Message Digest Algorithm 5, and is a hash value.  
A hash value is a something like a fingerprint, unique identifier of the file.  
Large files, such as 2G size, are sometime failed to download or copy. So, you should compare hash values of the original file and copied one. You can create the hash value of your copy, like this.  
```
$ brew install coreutils # coreutils includes some commands. e.g. gmd5sum
$ gmd5sum Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf.gz

#=> a0764a80311aee369375c5c7dda7e266  Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf.gz

$ cat Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf.gz.md5

#=> a0764a80311aee369375c5c7dda7e266  /humgen/gsa-scr1/pub/bundle/2.8/b37/Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf.gz
```
You probably see the same hash values.

Let's uncompress .gz files.
```
$ gunzip Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf.gz
$ gunzip Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf.idx.gz
$ gunzip dbsnp_138.b37.vcf.gz
$ gunzip dbsnp_138.b37.vcf.idx.gz
```

More detail information of resource bundle https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article.php?id=11017

I know you are tired for downloading. To be honest, I'm too.  
Most part of molecular work are occupied by pipetting, most part of bioinformatic work are occupied by preparing and data cleaning. Please calm down :sob:  

Before starting analysis, we have to check your directory and files. To avoid to take a bad slipping.  
`$ pwd`  
Are you in the working directory (exome_analysis)? If not, change directory by type this command.  
`$ cd ~/exome_analysis`  
Are these tools ready?
```
$ java -version
$ bwa
$ samtools --version
$ ls -vlhrt IGV_2.4.13/igv.sh
$ grep --version
$ ./tableview_darwin_amd64 -version
$ fastqc --version
$ java -jar Trimmomatic-0.38/trimmomatic-0.38.jar -version
$ picard SortSam -h
$ java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK-3.8-1-0-gf15c1c3ef/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar --version
```
Then, check files.  
`$ ls -vlhrt`  
Do you have same files?

    DRR006760_chr1_1.fastq.gz
    DRR006760_chr1_2.fastq.gz
    human_g1k_v37_decoy.fasta

    human_g1k_v37_decoy.fasta.pac
    human_g1k_v37_decoy.fasta.sa
    human_g1k_v37_decoy.dict
    Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf
    dbsnp_138.b37.vcf

Lastly, move old files, generated in last section, to other directory. Here, it is named as zzold.
```
$ mkdir zzold
$ mv DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads.sam zzold/
$ mv DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads.bam zzold/
$ mv DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads_sorted.bam zzold/
$ mv DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads_sorted.bam.bai zzold/
```

## Let's step forward

FASTQ format - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format

ここに手順の概略を

```
$ id=DRR006760_chr1
$ echo ${id}
```
Here, id is a variable. It can keep a specific value.  
We will use this variable to present the sample name.

From Trimmomatic web page,
- TRAILING: Cut bases off the end of a read, if below a threshold quality
- MINLEN: Drop the read if it is below a specified length

threads 4?  
Thread means threads of execution. Roughly saying, dividing a single task to four parts to reduce the calculation time.  
phred33??
Phred score is originally developed for Sanger sequence. So, I expect you already know well.  

This fastq file encodes quality values with Sanger institute-style. It's offset is 33.  
There is another option, phred64. It is for Solexa-style, Illumina 1.3+-style, Illumina 1.5+-style.  
The offset of Illumina 1.8+ is 33. Crazy. Unbelievable. I can't understand what they want to do :weary:  
See more detail at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format

`$ ls -hl ${id}*fastq.gz`

Can you see two .paired.fastq.gz?

### Mapping sequence reads to the reference genome < 1min
```
$ bwa mem -t4 -M \
            -R "@RG\tID:FLOWCELLID\tSM:${id}\tPL:illumina\tLB:${id}_library_1" \
            human_g1k_v37_decoy.fasta \
            ${id}_1.paired.fastq.gz ${id}_2.paired.fastq.gz > ${id}.aligned_reads.sam

$ samtools view -@4 -1 ${id}.aligned_reads.sam > ${id}.aligned_reads.bam
$ samtools sort -@4 -m 2G ${id}.aligned_reads.bam -o ${id}.aligned_reads_sorted.bam
$ samtools index ${id}.aligned_reads_sorted.bam
```
These lines are almost same with previous bwa/samtools commands.

### (Optional)
This is another way. Connect bwa and samtools view/sort to speed up.
```
$ bwa mem -t4 -M \
              -R "@RG\tID:FLOWCELLID\tSM:DRR006760_chr1\tPL:illumina\tLB:DRR006760_chr1_library_1" \
              human_g1k_v37_decoy.fasta \
              DRR006760_chr1_1.fastq.gz DRR006760_chr1_2.fastq.gz | \
              samtools view -@4 -1 - | samtools sort -@4 - -o - > DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads_sorted.bam
$ samtools index -@ 4 DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads_sorted.bam
```

Check the file size of generated .bam files.  
`$ ls -hl ${id}.aligned_reads.bam ${id}.aligned_reads_sorted.bam`

### MarkDuplicates <  1min
Remove (or just add mark) PCR duplicates entries in .bam file.  
```
$ picard MarkDuplicates \
       INPUT=${id}.aligned_reads_sorted.bam \
       OUTPUT=${id}.aligned_reads_dedup_sorted.bam \
       METRICS_FILE=${id}.duplicate.metrics \
       VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT \
       ASSUME_SORTED=true REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true
$ samtools index ${id}.aligned_reads_dedup_sorted.bam
```

Check the file size of generated .bam files.  
`$ ls -hl ${id}.aligned_reads_sorted.bam; ls -hl ${id}.aligned_reads_dedup_sorted.bam`  
By MarkDuplicates with remove_duplicates option, PCR duplicated entires are removed from .bam contents. So, file size is reduced.  
For detail information of generated metrics, see https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/picard-metric-definitions.html#DuplicationMetrics

### BaseRecalibrator < 2min
Base quality score recalibration (BQSR) is a process to model these errors empirically and adjust the quality scores accordingly. This allows us to get more accurate base qualities, which in turn improves the accuracy of our variant calls.

```
-L is a option for specifying chromosome, or chromosomal location. e.g. -L chr1:123-123450  
If you were doing whole genome analysis, you don't use this option.  
If you were doing whole exome analysis, there may be several choices.

# Third step
Exam. In other words, homework. But, don't move data to your home!  
Solve our 200 cases, include many unknown cases. Patient ID are removed. No hint. Most of cases are easy. Some cases are quit difficult. I solved all the cases. Happy to see your excellent result :satisfied:

## Tips: using memory, avoid using slow hard disk for speeding up
We did alignment using bwa program previously. As you can see, the bwa command was long, and included samtools command.  
This is done by "|". **Pipe**. "|" connects two command. In previous command, connected bwa and samtools. The result of bwa aligned data passed to samtools. This is very important. Why? If we used "|", we can use memory space instead of writing data to the very slow hard disk. Memory speed is extrem faster than hard disk.  
Let's experience (but, if you used small data, you can't feel it).  
```
$ bwa mem -t4 -M \
              -R "@RG\tID:FLOWCELLID\tSM:DRR006760_chr1\tPL:illumina\tLB:DRR006760_chr1_library_1" \

$ samtools view -@4 -1 DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads.sam -o DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads.bam
$ samtools sort -@4  DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads.bam -o DRR006760_chr1.aligned_reads_sorted.bam
